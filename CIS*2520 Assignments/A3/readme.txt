************
To compile this program execute one of the following command line arguments while in A3 directory:

for the 1st qs: make q1
then: ./q1 <expression>

for the 2nd qs: make q2 then ./q2 f.dat

****************
Sample output
****************
- 1st question works well with example given and should work well with any equation given that is in complete paranthesis form i.e (1+(1+2)) will work but 1 + (1+2) will be buggy. assumes full paranthesis
- 2nd question ; not sure if correct output is produced as i didnt have much time to spend on it but tried as much as i can to write  functions for part marks
